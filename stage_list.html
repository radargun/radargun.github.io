          <li>fail-on-null [optional]: If entry is null, fail immediately. Default is false.</li>
          <li>first-entry-offset [optional]: Index of key of the first entry.</li>
          <li>first-entry-offset-slave-index [optional]: Index of key of the first entry. This number will be multiplied by slaveIndex. Default is 0. Has precedence over 'first-entry-offset'.</li>
          <li>groups [optional]: Specifies in which groups this stage should actively run. The result set is intersection of specified slaves, groups and roles. Default is all groups.</li>
          <li>ignore-sum [optional]: Usually the test checks that sum of local nodes = numOwners * numEntries + extraEntries.This option disables such behaviour. Default is false.</li>
          <li>key-generator [optional]: Generator of keys (transforms key ID into key object). By default the generator is retrieved from slave state.</li>
          <li>live-slaves-hint [optional]: Hint how many slaves are currently alive - if set to &gt; 0 then the query for number of entries in this cache is postponed until the cache appears to be fully replicated. By default this is disabled.</li>
          <li>log-checks-count [optional]: Number of queries after which a DEBUG log message is printed. Default is 10000.</li>
          <li>memory-only [optional]: If the cache wrapper supports persistent storage and this is set to true, the check will be executed only against in-memory data. Default is false.</li>
          <li>num-entries [mandatory]: Number of entries with key in form specified by the last used key generator, in the cache.</li>
          <li>roles [optional]: Specifies on which slaves this stage should actively run, by their roles. The result set is intersection of specified slaves, groups and roles. Supported roles are [COORDINATOR]. Default is all roles.</li>
          <li>size-only [optional]: If true, the entries are not retrieved, this stage only checks that the sum of entries from local nodes is correct. Default is false.</li>
          <li>slaves [optional]: Specifies on which slaves this stage should actively run. The result set is intersection of specified slaves, groups and roles. Default is all slaves.</li>
          <li>step-entry-count [optional]: Number of entries stepped in each step. Default is 1.</li>
          <li>value-generator [optional]: Generator of values. By default the generator is retrieved from slave state.</li>
        </ul>
